1debit github metarepo, stores things like github action templates


### WARNING: this repo is public.

Apparently the `.github` metarepo in an org has to be public in order for the action templates to show up in the "add workflow" catalog in other chime repos. This is according to githubs docs, pretty crappy requirement for an enterprise product if you ask me.
